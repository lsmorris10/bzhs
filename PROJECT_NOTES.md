# Project Notes

## Development Workflow (Permanent)

**Primary coding environment:** Replit Agent
**Testing environment:** Antigravity (local PC)

| Environment | Role | Push Frequency |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Replit** | Main coding, building, pushing to GitHub | Most pushes |
| **Antigravity** | Pull, test mod in-game on local PC, occasional code + push | Less frequent |

**Sync Rules:**
1. **Before coding in Antigravity:** Always `git pull` first to grab latest from Replit.
2. **Before starting work in Replit after an Antigravity session:** Run `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master` to pick up anything pushed from Antigravity.
3. **Never squash or rebase from Replit** — Replit cannot force-push to GitHub. Do history cleanup from Antigravity only.
4. **Replit auto-creates checkpoint commits** ("Transitioned from Plan to Build mode", task completion commits). This is normal. Squash from Antigravity if cleaner history is desired, then sync Replit with step 2.
5. **Replit creates `subrepl-*` branches** for parallel task agents. These are temporary and can be deleted from Antigravity after tasks are merged.

## Current Status & Next Up

**Completed Milestones:** 1 (Scaffold), 2 (Player Stats), 3 (Debuffs — all 12 types), 4 (Temperature — partial), 5 (Heatmap), 6 (Loot & Crafting), 7 (XP/Leveling/Perks), 8 (Blood Moon/Horde Night), 9 (HUD — compass, minimap, stats overlay).

**Next Tasks:**
- **Sprint bug fix** — Client-side Mixin on `LocalPlayer.aiStep()` to properly cancel sprint when stamina is depleted.
- **Custom textures & models** — Replace scaled zombie renderers with proper custom models and textures for each variant.
- **World generation** — Custom biomes, structures, and POI generation per the spec.

## Known Bugs / Polish To Address

1. **SPRINT BUG — FIX ANOTHER DAY** (unresolved since Milestone 2):
   - Sprint can get stuck — holding W alone gives infinite sprint. Stamina drains but sprint doesn't cancel. Needs a client-side Mixin on `LocalPlayer.aiStep()`.
   - **Not on today's test list.** This is a known issue that requires a proper client-side fix.
