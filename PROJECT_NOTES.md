# Project Notes

## Current Status & Next Up

**Next Tasks:**
- **Sprint bug fix** — Client-side Mixin on `LocalPlayer.aiStep()` to properly cancel sprint when stamina is depleted.
- **HUD Polish** — Compass and Minimap.
- **Loot & crafting system** (Spec §5-6) — Custom loot tables, crafting recipes, and item progression.
- **Custom textures & models** — Replace scaled zombie renderers with proper custom models and textures for each variant.
- **World generation** — Custom biomes, structures, and POI generation per the spec.

## Pending Testing (March 12, 2026)

### Build Verification
- [ ] Run `./gradlew build` — confirm it compiles cleanly with zero errors

### Systems to Verify In-Game
- **Temperature:** [ ] Check 0.3°F/s adjustment rate and biomes shifts.
- **Debuffs:** [ ] Check Infection/Bleeding effects (Bleeding drains -1 HP/3s, Infection stages).
- **Horde Spawn Balance:** [ ] Trigger blood moon/horde wave, verify counts and zombie composition.
- **Heatmap Spawning:** 
  - [ ] Break blocks (+0.5 heat) and place torches (+2 heat).
  - [ ] Verify `/7dtm heat` reports correct values.
  - [ ] Heat 25+ (scout Walkers), 50+ (Screamer), 75+ (Mini-horde).
  - [ ] Verify `/7dtm heat_clear` resets heat and heat decays over time.
- **HUD Changes:** 
  - [ ] Verify vanilla hunger (drumsticks) and vanilla health (hearts) are hidden.
  - [ ] Confirm custom HUD shows Food, Water, Stamina, and HP correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** [ ] Spawn all zombie types (no crashes), test modifier variants, cross-system interactions (heatmap during blood moon).

## Known Bugs / Polish To Address

1. **SPRINT BUG — FIX ANOTHER DAY** (unresolved since Milestone 2):
   - Sprint can get stuck — holding W alone gives infinite sprint. Stamina drains but sprint doesn't cancel. Needs a client-side Mixin on `LocalPlayer.aiStep()`.
   - **Not on today's test list.** This is a known issue that requires a proper client-side fix.

2. **TODO — HUD polish**: Compass/minimap not yet started.
