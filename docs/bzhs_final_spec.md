# PART 1 — CORE SYSTEMS (Sections 1–7)

---

## 1. Core Survival & Character Systems

**Goal**: Completely replace vanilla hunger, health, and saturation with a 7DTD-style multi-resource survival system.

### 1.1 Player Stats

| Stat | Default Max | Regen Rate | Drain Conditions | Mixin Target |
|------|------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Health** | 100 (+ 10/level to 200 cap) | 0.5/sec when Food>50% & Water>50% | Combat damage, fall, fire, infection, radiation | `LivingEntity.hurt()`, `Player.getFoodData()` |
| **Stamina** | 100 (+ 5/perk) | 8/sec at rest; 4/sec while walking | Sprint (−10/s), melee swing (−8–25), mining (−5/swing), jump (−8) | New capability on `Player` |
| **Food (Fullness)** | 100 | — | Passive drain −0.2/min + activity multiplier | Override `FoodData` entirely |
| **Water (Hydration)** | 100 | — | Passive drain −0.3/min + heat biome multiplier (×1.5 desert) | New stat in custom `FoodData` |
| **Core Temperature** | 70°F baseline | Adjusts ±2°F/sec toward ambient | Biome, altitude, time of day, clothing, fires, wetness | New system; no vanilla equivalent |

**Starvation/Dehydration cascade:**
- Food < 30 → stamina regen halved.
- Food < 10 → health drains −0.5/sec.
- Food = 0 → health drains −2/sec, movement −40%.
- Water follows identical thresholds with separate tracking.

**Water Collection — Dew Collector (2.6 Update):**
- **Dew Collector Block**: Craftable (Scrap Iron ×8, Duct Tape ×2, Plant Fiber ×4). Placed outdoors.
- **Requires Glass Jars as fuel**: Insert empty Glass Jars into the collector. Each jar fills over 60 min (real time) → produces 1 Jar of Murky Water.
- **Jar refund chance**: 60% chance the Glass Jar is returned after water extraction (config `dewCollector.jarRefundChance`, float 0.0–1.0, default 0.6).
- **Glass Jar crafting**: Forge recipe — Sand (×2) + Clay (×1) → Glass Jar (×3). **No crucible required** (2.6 change).
- **Config**: `dewCollector.fillTimeSec` (int, default 3600), `dewCollector.enabled` (bool, default true).

### 1.2 Health Conditions & Debuffs

| Condition | Trigger | Effect | Cure | Duration |
|-----------|---------|--------|------|----------|
| **Bleeding** | Melee hit (30% chance per zombie hit) | −1 HP/3sec | Bandage, First Aid Bandage | Until cured or death |
| **Infection (Stage 1)** | Zombie hit (10% base, +5%/feral) | Stamina regen −25% | Honey, Herbal Antibiotics | 24h → Stage 2 |
| **Infection (Stage 2)** | Untreated Stage 1 | −0.5 HP/sec, vision blur | Antibiotics only | 24h → death |
| **Dysentery** | Drinking murky water (100%), raw meat (40%) | Water drains ×3, food drains ×2 | Goldenrod Tea + rest | 60 min |
| **Sprain** | Fall 4–7 blocks | Movement −30% | Splint | 30 min after splint |
| **Fracture** | Fall 8+ blocks | Movement −60%, no sprint | Plaster Cast (Splint + Duct Tape) | 60 min after cast |
| **Concussion** | Explosion within 3 blocks | Screen shake, aim sway +50% | Time only | 45 sec |
| **Burn** | Fire/lava contact, Molotov, Infernal zombie hit | −2 HP/sec while active, then −0.5/sec lingering | Aloe Cream | 10 sec active + 20 sec linger |
| **Hypothermia** | Core Temp < 32°F for 120sec (90sec in 2.6 wasteland cold event) | Stamina drain ×2, movement −20% | Warm clothing, campfire proximity | Until temp > 50°F |
| **Hyperthermia** | Core Temp > 110°F for 120sec (90sec in 2.6 wasteland hot event) | Water drain ×3, stamina drain ×1.5 | Shade, cold drinks, remove clothing layers | Until temp < 100°F |
| **Radiation Sickness** | Wasteland biome exposure / Radiation Storm | −1 HP/5sec, max health reduces by 1/30sec | Rad-Away pills + leave zone | Until cured |
| **Electrocuted** | Charged zombie chain attack | No movement 1.5sec, −5 HP burst | None | 1.5 sec |
| **Stunned** | Cop zombie bile, Demolisher blast | No movement 2sec | None | 2 sec |

**Debuff stacking rules:**
- Multiple bleeds: Damage stacks (max 3 stacks = −1 HP/sec).
- Infection + Dysentery: Both apply independently.
- Fracture overrides Sprain (worse replaces lesser on same limb).
- Electrocuted and Stunned do not stack (longest remaining wins).
- All debuffs render as HUD icons with countdown timers.
- Visual effects: Bleeding = red vignette pulse; Infection = green tint + cough particles; Dysentery = stomach gurgle audio; Fracture = limping animation override; Electrocuted = blue screen flash + spark particles.

### 1.3 Heatmap System

The Heatmap is an invisible per-chunk value (0–100) that drives enemy spawns.

**Heat sources:**

| Activity | Heat/Event | Radius (chunks) | Decay Rate |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Gunshot | +15 | 6 | −2/min |
| Forge running | +3/min (capped +30) | 4 | −1/min |
| Campfire | +1/min (capped +10) | 2 | −1/min |
| Mining (per block) | +0.5 | 3 | −2/min |
| Sprinting | +0.2/sec | 2 | −3/min |
| Torch placement | +2 (one-time) | 1 | −1/min |
| Vehicle engine | +5/sec | 5 | −2/min |
| Screamer scream | +40 (instant) | 8 | −1/min |
| Explosion | +25 | 6 | −2/min |

**Spawn thresholds:**
- Heat 25+: Scout zombies begin investigating (1–2 wanderers).
- Heat 50+: Screamer spawns guaranteed within 60 sec.
- Heat 75+: Mini-horde (8–12 zombies) spawns from nearest dark area.
- Heat 100: Continuous wave spawns every 90 sec until heat decays below 75.

**Config**: `heatmap.enabled` (bool, default true), `heatmap.decayMultiplier` (float, 0.1–5.0, default 1.0), `heatmap.spawnThresholdMultiplier` (float, 0.5–3.0, default 1.0).

### 1.4 Character Level & XP

**XP Sources (2.6 Rebalanced):**

| Activity | Base XP | Multiplier | 2.6 Notes |
|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Zombie kill (Walker) | 200 | ×1.0 | ↑ from 150 |
| Zombie kill (Feral) | 350 | ×1.0 | New tier |
| Zombie kill (Radiated) | 500 | ×1.0 | ↑ from 225 |
| Zombie kill (Charged) | 550 | ×1.0 | **NEW 2.6** |
| Zombie kill (Infernal) | 550 | ×1.0 | **NEW 2.6** |
| Zombie kill (Demolisher) | 800 | ×1.0 | ↑ from 450 |
| Zombie kill (Behemoth) | 2000 | ×1.0 | Boss XP |
| Player kill (PvP) | 500 | ×1.0 | ↑ from 0 (2.6) |
| Animal kill | 50–200 (by type) | — | — |
| Block mined | 1–5 (by hardness) | — | — |
| Item crafted | 5–50 (by complexity) | ×1.5 if first time | — |
| Quest completed | 200–2000 | Tier multiplier | — |
| Loot container opened (first time) | 10–30 | — | — |
| POI cleared | 500–3000 | By tier | — |

**Leveling formula:** `XP_to_next = floor(1000 × level ^ 1.05)` — Level 1→2 = 1000 XP, Level 50→51 = ~72,400 XP, soft cap at level 300.

Each level-up grants **1 perk point**. Every 10 levels grants **1 bonus attribute point**.

---

## 2. World Generation & Biomes

**Goal**: Replace the entire Overworld with a post-apocalyptic 7DTD landscape. Disable Nether/End portals (config option to re-enable).

### 2.1 Biome Definitions (2.6 Updated Spawns & Weather)

| Biome | Temperature | Zombie Density | Loot Tier | Special Features | 2.6 Updates |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Pine Forest** | 50–70°F | Low (×0.6) | 1–3 | Starter-friendly, deer/rabbits, log cabins | — |
| **Forest** | 55–75°F | Medium (×1.0) | 2–4 | Mixed POIs, small towns, varied wildlife | — |
| **Plains** | 60–85°F | Medium (×1.0) | 2–4 | Wide open, farms, wind exposure | — |
| **Desert** | 85–130°F | Medium (×1.2) | 3–5 | Water scarcity, oil shale, rattlesnakes | — |
| **Snowy (Tundra)** | −10–32°F | Low-Med (×0.8) | 3–5 | Hypothermia risk, wolves, igloos/bunkers | **2.6**: +Radiated/Charged/Infernal Chuck spawns; cold snap events (−30°F, 10 min) |
| **Burned Forest** | 70–90°F | High (×1.5) | 3–5 | Ash particles, dead trees, charred buildings | — |
| **Wasteland** | 80–110°F + radiation | Extreme (×2.5) | 5–6 | Radiation zones, feral-only, military POIs | **2.6**: +Radiated/Charged/Infernal Chuck spawns; hot events (140°F, hyperthermia ×1.5 onset); cold events (10°F, hypothermia ×1.5 onset); **Radiation Storms** (§15.1) |

**Wasteland Dynamic Weather (2.6 NEW):**
- **Heat Wave**: 15% chance per in-game day. Ambient temp spikes to 140°F for 10 min. Hyperthermia onset timer reduced to 90sec.
- **Cold Snap**: 10% chance per in-game day (night only). Ambient temp drops to 10°F for 10 min. Hypothermia onset timer reduced to 90sec.
- **Radiation Storm**: 8% chance per in-game day. Green fog + particle effects. Radiation damage ticks even in shelter (reduced by 50% indoors). Duration 5 min. See §15.1.
- **Config**: `wasteland.heatWaveChance` (float), `wasteland.coldSnapChance` (float), `wasteland.radStormChance` (float).

### 2.2 City & POI Generation

**City generation pipeline:**
1. Voronoi partition world into "regions" (2048×2048 blocks).
2. Each region rolls city density: 0 (wilderness), 1 (hamlet, 5–10 POIs), 2 (town, 20–50 POIs), 3 (city, 100–300 POIs).
3. Generate road grid (main roads 5-wide asphalt, side streets 3-wide).
4. Place POIs from template pool along roads with setback rules.
5. Fill remaining lots with parking lots, parks, rubble.

**2.6 RWG Tweaks**: Increased weight for Trader compound tiles and large-cap (Tier 4–5) POI tiles in the random generation pool, ensuring traders appear more frequently and large dungeon-style POIs are less rare.

**POI template system:**
- Templates stored as `.nbt` structure files in `/data/sevendaystominecraft/structures/pois/`.
- Each template has metadata JSON: `tier` (1–5), `biomes` (allowed), `size` (footprint), `lootContainers` (list of positions + loot table IDs), `zombieSpawnPoints` (positions + variant weights), `questTarget` (bool).
- Templates are rotatable (0/90/180/270) and mirror-able.
- ~300 templates at launch; framework supports **data packs** for community templates.
- **Datapack extensibility**: Third-party datapacks can add POIs by placing `.nbt` files and corresponding metadata JSON in `data/<namespace>/structures/pois/`. The mod scans all loaded datapacks at world load.

**POI categories (minimum set):**

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Residential | 60+ | Suburban houses (10 variants), apartments, trailer parks, cabins |
| Commercial | 50+ | Gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, bars, gun shops, hardware stores |
| Industrial | 30+ | Factories, warehouses, water treatment, power plants |
| Civic | 20+ | Police stations, fire departments, hospitals, schools, churches |
| Military | 15+ | Army bases, bunkers, checkpoints, crashed helicopters |
| Wilderness | 25+ | Caves, mineshafts, campgrounds, ranger stations, hunting blinds |
| Special | 10+ | Trader compounds, quest-only POIs, boss lairs |

### 2.3 Terrain & Block Palette

- **Surface blocks**: Asphalt, concrete sidewalks, dirt road, gravel, sand, snow layer, ash.
- **Building blocks**: Drywall, brick, commercial metal, corrugated iron, rebar concrete, bulletproof glass, steel plates.
- **Decorative/loot**: Filing cabinets, desks, refrigerators, couches, beds, bookshelves, medicine cabinets, gun safes, car wrecks (all function as containers).
- **Natural**: Ore nodes (iron, lead, nitrate, coal, oil shale, diamond/tungsten) replace vanilla ores with 7DTD equivalents.

### 2.4 Structural Integrity (SI)

| Material | SI (Max Support) | Weight | Horizontal Span |
|----------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Wood Frame | 10 | 1 | 3 blocks |
| Cobblestone | 30 | 3 | 5 blocks |
| Concrete | 60 | 5 | 8 blocks |
| Reinforced Concrete | 80 | 6 | 10 blocks |
| Steel | 100 | 8 | 15 blocks |

- Blocks not supported collapse after 0.5 sec delay (cascade possible).
- SI checked on block break/place using BFS from ground-connected pillars.
- **Config**: `structuralIntegrity.enabled` (bool, default true), `structuralIntegrity.collapseDelay` (ticks, default 10).

### 2.5 Voxel Destruction

- Every block is destructible (no bedrock except at y=−64).
- Block HP by material tier: Wood 100 → Cobble 500 → Concrete 1500 → Reinforced 3000 → Steel 5000.
- Explosions use spherical damage falloff: `damage = baseDamage × (1 − distance/radius)^2`.
- Damage persists across sessions (no vanilla block regeneration).
- **Mixin target**: `ServerLevel.destroyBlock()`, `Block.getDestroyProgress()`.

---

## 3. Mobs, Zombies & AI

**Goal**: Replace ALL vanilla hostile mobs with 7DTD zombie variants. Vanilla animals partially replaced.

### 3.1 Zombie Variants (2.6 Updated — Including Charged & Infernal)

| Variant | HP | Damage | Speed (b/s) | Special | Spawn Day | XP (2.6) | Loot |

**2.6 Biome Spawn Adjustments (Snow & Wasteland):**
- Snow/Tundra: Radiated, Charged, and Infernal Chuck zombies now appear at day 21+ (previously only Walkers/Lumberjacks). Spawn weight: 15% Charged, 10% Infernal, 15% Radiated in day 28+ pools.
- Wasteland: Charged and Infernal variants start from day 14+. Feral variants remain dominant. All mutated variants have extended 11-block ranged attack.

### 3.2 Zombie AI System

**Priority-based behavior tree:**
```
Root (Selector)
├── [1] Flee → only Screamer when player within 5 blocks after screaming
├── [2] Attack Target → if player/block in range
│   ├── Melee attack (within 2 blocks)
│   ├── Ranged attack (Cop bile / Mutated vomit, if >4 blocks; Charged chain, if >2 blocks)
│   └── Block destruction (pathfind to player, destroy blocks in path)
├── [3] Investigate → move toward heat source / last known player pos
├── [3.5] Smell Track (3.0 Teaser) → move toward player smell trail (see below)
├── [4] Horde Path → during Blood Moon, path to player using A* with block-break cost
└── [5] Wander → random movement within spawn chunk
```

**Charged Zombie AI additions:**
- On melee hit, triggers `ChainLightningEvent`: scans 3-block radius for additional `LivingEntity` targets (max 3 chains). Each chain deals 5 HP + applies `Electrocuted` debuff (1.5s stun). Visual: blue arc particle between entities.
- Chain does NOT arc through blocks (line-of-sight check per target).

**Infernal Zombie AI additions:**
- Every 20 ticks while moving, places a `FIRE_TRAIL` block at current position (burns for 5 sec, deals 2 HP/sec to entities). Fire trails do not spread to adjacent blocks.
- Melee hit applies `Burn` debuff (5s active burn).
- Immune to fire damage itself.

**Smell System (3.0 Preview — Placeholder Hooks):**
- Players emit a "smell value" based on: raw meat in inventory (+20), blood (+15 if bleeding), recent cooking (+10 for 5 min), no shower/water contact for 60+ min (+5).
- Zombies within 20 blocks can detect smell > 15 and path toward the smell source.
- **Implementation**: Hooks and capability registered but gated behind config `smell.enabled` (bool, default false). Full implementation deferred to future 3.0 alignment update.
- Data stored as `SmellCapability` on Player entity.

**Pathfinding details:**
- Custom A* implementation with block-break cost function: `cost = baseCost + (blockHP / zombieDamage) × timeMultiplier`.
- Zombies prefer paths through weakest blocks (wood doors > windows > drywall > concrete).
- During Blood Moon, zombies receive global pathing toward nearest player with 64-block scan radius, expanded to 128 on day 21+.
- Spider Zombies add vertical edges (wall climb) to pathfinding graph.
- Group coordination: When 3+ zombies target same block, damage stacks (simulating coordinated bashing).

**Spawning rules:**
- Day: Zombies spawn in dark areas, indoors POIs, underground. Outdoor spawns only biome wanderers (low density).
- Night (18:00–06:00): Spawn rate ×3, all zombies sprint-capable gain +50% speed.
- Blood Moon: Override all spawn rules. Dedicated horde spawner activates.
- Spawn cap: `maxZombies = baseMax + (dayNumber × 2)` capped at config max (default 64 per player, configurable 16–256).

### 3.3 Animals (2.6 Updated)

| Animal | HP | Behavior | Drops | 2.6 Notes |
|--------|-----|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Deer** | 80 | Flees on sight (24-block range) | Raw Venison (×3), Bone (×2), Animal Hide (×2) | — |
| **Rabbit** | 15 | Flees on sound | Raw Rabbit (×1), Bone (×1) | — |
| **Chicken** | 10 | Wanders, farmable | Raw Chicken, Feather, Egg (1/day if alive) | **2.6**: Roaming cluck ambient sounds every 15–30 sec |
| **Boar** | 150 | Neutral → hostile if hit | Raw Pork (×4), Animal Fat (×2), Bone (×3) | — |
| **Wolf** | 120 | Hostile at night, neutral day | Raw Meat (×2), Animal Hide (×3), Bone (×2) | — |
| **Bear** | 400 | Hostile at 12-block range | Raw Meat (×6), Animal Fat (×4), Bone (×5), Bear Hide | **2.6**: Can fit through 1×2 spaces (1 wide × 2 tall); collision box adjusted |
| **Snake** | 30 | Desert, attacks if stepped on | Venom Sac, Raw Meat (×1) | **2.6**: Plays footstep/slither sounds when moving (audible within 8 blocks) |

**Bear pathing (2.6):** Bear entity's bounding box reduced from 1.4×1.4 to 0.95×1.8 when in "squeeze" mode (navigating through 1-wide gaps). Triggers `BearSqueezeEvent` for AI path recalculation. Bears can now breach 1-wide doorways.

## 4. Horde Nights / Blood Moon Events

### 4.1 Blood Moon Mechanics

### 14.7 Player Animation & Immersion Enhancements

**Goal**: Add movement-aware player model animations that respond to held item type, sprinting state, and environmental conditions. All modifications stay MC-native — vanilla `HumanoidModel` arm/body part adjustments + particle emitters, no skeletal IK or custom bone rigs.

#### 14.7.1 Sprint Animations by Held Item

When the player is sprinting (`player.isSprinting() == true`), the arm and held-item pose adjusts based on item category. All poses smoothly interpolate from idle over 4 ticks (`lerpFactor = 0.25`) to avoid jarring pops.

| Item Category | Items Included | Dominant Arm Pose | Off-Hand Pose | Body Lean | Head Offset | Bob/Sway |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Firearms — Pistol/SMG** | Pistol, SMG, Pipe Pistol | Elbow bent 90°, gun at chest height (low-ready position). `rightArm.xRot = -0.8f`, `rightArm.zRot = -0.15f` | Tucked against body, `leftArm.xRot = -0.6f` | Forward 5°: `body.xRot = 0.09f` | Slight downward tilt: `head.xRot += 0.05f` | Lateral sway: `sin(limbSwing × 0.5) × 0.04f` on both arms. Vertical bob: `cos(limbSwing × 0.5) × 0.03f` |
| **Firearms — Rifle/Sniper** | Hunting Rifle, Sniper, AK-47, M60, Pipe Rifle | Both hands on rifle at chest: `rightArm.xRot = -0.9f`, `rightArm.yRot = 0.1f` | Supporting barrel: `leftArm.xRot = -1.0f`, `leftArm.yRot = -0.2f` | Forward 7°: `body.xRot = 0.12f` | Level: `head.xRot += 0.03f` | Reduced sway (weapon stabilized): `sin(limbSwing × 0.4) × 0.02f`. Slight diagonal motion |
| **Firearms — Shotgun** | Shotgun, Pipe Shotgun | One-hand low carry at hip: `rightArm.xRot = -0.4f`, `rightArm.zRot = -0.1f` | Free arm pumps: vanilla swing cycle ×1.2 | Forward 4°: `body.xRot = 0.07f` | Neutral | Hip sway: `sin(limbSwing × 0.6) × 0.05f` |
| **Melee — Club/Sledge** | Wooden Club, Baseball Bat, Sledgehammer | Weapon over shoulder: `rightArm.xRot = -2.2f`, `rightArm.zRot = 0.3f` (arm angled back) | Arm pump (vanilla-enhanced): swing amplitude ×1.4 | Forward 6°: `body.xRot = 0.10f` | Slight forward: `head.xRot += 0.06f` | Heavy momentum bob: `cos(limbSwing × 0.4) × 0.06f` |
| **Melee — Knife/Machete** | Hunting Knife, Machete, Steel Knuckles | Blade held low at side, arm slightly back: `rightArm.xRot = 0.3f`, `rightArm.zRot = -0.2f` | Natural arm pump (vanilla) | Forward 8° (aggressive lean): `body.xRot = 0.14f` | Forward tilt: `head.xRot += 0.08f` | Quick sway: `sin(limbSwing × 0.7) × 0.03f` |
| **Melee — Spear** | Iron Spear | Spear held diagonally across body: `rightArm.xRot = -1.5f`, `rightArm.yRot = 0.3f` | Guiding hand mid-shaft: `leftArm.xRot = -1.2f` | Forward 5°: `body.xRot = 0.09f` | Level | Subtle diagonal bounce: `sin(limbSwing × 0.5) × 0.04f` |
| **Tools** | Pickaxe, Shovel, Stone Axe, Fire Axe | Tool held at side, slight swing: `rightArm.xRot = 0.1f`, `rightArm.zRot = -0.25f` | Arm pump (vanilla) | Forward 4°: `body.xRot = 0.07f` | Neutral | Side swing: `sin(limbSwing × 0.6) × 0.05f` + shoulder roll: `rightArm.zRot += sin(limbSwing × 0.3) × 0.08f` |
| **Bow/Crossbow** | All bows, Compound Crossbow | Bow slung forward, arrow nocked: `rightArm.xRot = -1.1f`, `rightArm.yRot = 0.15f` | Gripping bow body: `leftArm.xRot = -1.0f`, `leftArm.yRot = -0.1f` | Forward 5°: `body.xRot = 0.09f` | Slightly up (scanning): `head.xRot -= 0.04f` | Minimal sway (precision carry): `sin(limbSwing × 0.4) × 0.02f` |
| **Empty Hands / Other** | No item, food, misc | Natural arm pump (enhanced vanilla): swing amplitude ×1.3, faster cycle ×1.2 | Mirror of right arm | Forward 6°: `body.xRot = 0.10f` | Neutral | Backpack/chest sway via `body.zRot = sin(limbSwing × 0.3) × 0.04f` (torso micro-twist simulating pack weight) |
| **Stun Baton** | Stun Baton | Held forward at hip, angled out: `rightArm.xRot = -0.5f`, `rightArm.zRot = -0.15f` | Guard position: `leftArm.xRot = -0.4f` | Forward 5°: `body.xRot = 0.09f` | Neutral | Electrical crackle particle on baton tip every 10 ticks while sprinting |

**Animation blending:**
- All sprint pose values lerp from current → target over 4 ticks when sprint starts.
- On sprint stop, lerp back to idle pose over 6 ticks (slightly slower for natural decel feel).
- During sprint-jump, temporarily reduce arm sway amplitude by 50% and increase body forward lean by 3°.
- Bob frequencies reference `limbSwing` (vanilla walk cycle parameter) which naturally scales with player movement speed.

**Mixin targets:**
- `net.minecraft.client.model.HumanoidModel.setupAnim()` — `@Inject(at = TAIL)` to apply sprint pose overrides after vanilla anim setup.
- `net.minecraft.client.model.PlayerModel.setupAnim()` — Same pattern; `PlayerModel` extends `HumanoidModel` with arm sleeve layers.
- Item category detection via `player.getMainHandItem().getItem() instanceof` checks against mod item class hierarchy.

#### 14.7.2 Environmental Sprint VFX

Particle and visual effects triggered by sprint state + environment conditions. All client-side only — no server packets needed.

| VFX | Trigger | Particle / Shader | Rate | Details |
|-----|---------|-------------------|------|---------|
| **Dust kick-up** | Sprinting on dirt, sand, gravel, or path blocks | `ParticleTypes.BLOCK` (tinted to surface block color) | 2 particles/tick at foot position | Spawn at `player.getY()` with slight upward velocity `(0, 0.05, 0)` + random spread `±0.15` on X/Z. On sand: particles are tan/beige. On dirt: brown. Gravel: gray. Size: 0.6–1.0× (random) |
| **Breath fog** | Sprinting OR walking when Core Temp < 40°F | Custom particle `BREATH_FOG` (white translucent puff, 12-tick lifespan) | Sprint: 1 puff every 16 ticks. Walk: 1 every 40 ticks. Standing still in cold: 1 every 60 ticks | Emitted from `player.getEyePosition()` offset forward 0.3 blocks. Drift direction matches player look + slight upward. Opacity fades from 0.6 → 0 over lifespan. Size: 0.15–0.25 blocks |
| **Sweat/heat particles** | Sprinting when Core Temp > 100°F | Custom particle `SWEAT_DROP` (small droplet, gravity-affected, 20-tick lifespan) | 1 every 20 ticks (sprint only) | Emitted from `player.getY() + eyeHeight - 0.2` with random offset `±0.2` on X/Z. Falls with gravity `0.04/tick`. Faint glistening effect (slightly transparent, white-blue tint). Not shown below 100°F |
| **Splashing** | Sprinting through rain or shallow water (waterlogged blocks) | `ParticleTypes.SPLASH` + `RAIN` | 3 particles/tick | Standard splash particles at foot level, increased rate vs vanilla walking |
| **Snow puff** | Sprinting on snow layers / snowy biome ground | `ParticleTypes.SNOWFLAKE` variant (white, small) | 2 particles/tick | Similar to dust but white, slightly more upward velocity `(0, 0.08, 0)` to simulate snow being kicked |

**Particle registration:**
- `BREATH_FOG` and `SWEAT_DROP` are custom `SimpleAnimatedParticle` subclasses registered via `RegisterParticleProvidersEvent`.
- Textures stored in `textures/particle/breath_fog.png` and `textures/particle/sweat_drop.png` (each 8×8 pixel sprite sheet, 4 frames).

#### 14.7.3 Third-Person Body Language

Additional model adjustments visible in third-person (F5) and to other players in multiplayer:

| Animation | Trigger | Model Change |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Exhaustion posture** | Stamina < 20% | `body.xRot += 0.15f` (hunched forward), arm swing amplitude ×0.6, head slight droop `head.xRot += 0.1f` |
| **Injured limp** | HP < 25% OR Fracture debuff | Right leg swing amplitude ×0.5 + slight delay (asymmetric gait). `rightLeg.yRot += sin(limbSwing) × 0.08f` |
| **Cold shiver** | Core Temp < 32°F | Random micro-jitter on all body parts: `±0.02f` on xRot/zRot, applied every 4 ticks (random). Arms tucked closer: `leftArm.zRot += 0.15f`, `rightArm.zRot -= 0.15f` |
| **Overheat wipe** | Core Temp > 110°F | Every 120 ticks: right arm briefly raises to forehead (`rightArm.xRot = -2.5f` for 8 ticks, then returns). Simulates wiping sweat |
| **Heavy carry** | Encumbrance > 80% | `body.xRot += 0.12f` (leaning forward under weight), reduced arm swing ×0.7, slower walk animation rate ×0.85 |

**Mixin targets (Third-Person):**
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.player.PlayerRenderer` — `@Inject` into `render()` to apply condition-based model adjustments.
- `net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.LivingEntityRenderer` — `@Inject` at `TAIL` of `render()` for particle attachment to rendered entity position.

  + wetModifier             // Rain/swim = −20°F
  + clothingInsulation      // Sum of equipped clothing insulation values
  + nearFireBonus           // +30°F within 5 blocks of fire
  + shelterBonus            // +10°F if enclosed (roof check)
  + weatherEventModifier    // 2.6: ±30–60°F during wasteland heat/cold events
```

- Comfortable range: 50–90°F (no effects).
- <50°F: Increasing cold debuffs. <32°F for 120sec = Hypothermia.
- \>90°F: Increasing heat debuffs. >110°F for 120sec = Hyperthermia.
- Clothing insulation values: Cloth ±2°F, Leather ±5°F, Military ±8°F, Parka +20°F, Poncho +15°F rain protection.

**Radiation Storms (2.6 NEW):**
- Wasteland-only dynamic weather event.
- 8% base chance per in-game day (config `wasteland.radStormChance`).
- Duration: 5 minutes game time.
- Effects: Ambient green fog; Geiger counter audio; all entities in wasteland biome chunks take −1 HP/3sec radiation damage.
- Shelter reduces damage by 50% (roof + walls check). Lead-lined blocks (Forged Steel + Lead Ingot) provide 100% radiation shielding.
- UI: Green radiation warning icon + storm timer on HUD.

### 15.2 Stealth System

- Crouch activates stealth mode. Detection based on:
  - **Noise**: Each action has a noise value (walking = 5, sprinting = 30, gunshot = 80+, silenced gun = 15).
  - **Light level**: Standing in light level >10 = easier detection.
  - **Distance**: Base detection radius = 15 blocks. Modified by zombie type.
  - **Movement**: Moving while crouched = 2× detection chance vs standing still.
- Stealth kill: Hit unaware zombie from behind = ×3.0 damage multiplier (+ Hidden Strike perk bonus; **×5.0 with Ghost mastery**).
- Detection states: **Unaware** → **Suspicious** (? icon) → **Alert** (! icon, runs at player).
- HUD stealth indicator: Eye icon, closed (hidden) → half-open (suspicious) → open (detected).

### 15.3 Forging System

Forge workstation UI:
- **Input slots**: Raw materials (iron, lead, clay, stone, brass, **sand (2.6)**).
- **Fuel slot**: Wood, coal.
- **Tool slot**: Anvil (for iron items), Crucible (for steel, requires clay + forged iron).
- **Smelt output**: Ingots/molten metal stored in forge internal buffer.
- **Crafting output**: Select recipe → consumes from internal buffer.

| Forge Recipe | Input | Output | Time (sec) |
|-------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Iron Ingot | Scrap Iron ×3 | Iron Ingot ×1 | 20 |
| Steel Ingot | Iron Ingot ×1 + Clay ×1 (in Crucible) | Forged Steel ×1 | 40 |
| Lead Ingot | Raw Lead ×3 | Lead Ingot ×1 | 15 |
| Bullet Casing | Brass ×1 | Casing ×6 | 10 |
| Iron Arrow Head | Iron Ingot ×1 | Arrow Head ×10 | 15 |
| Forged Iron Blade | Iron Ingot ×3 | Blade ×1 | 30 |
| Nails | Iron Ingot ×1 | Nails ×12 | 10 |
| Anvil | Forged Iron ×10 | Anvil ×1 (tool) | 120 |
| **Glass Jar** | **Sand ×2 + Clay ×1** | **Glass Jar ×3** | **15** | **(2.6 NEW)** |

### 15.4 Commands (OP/Admin Only)

| Command | Arguments | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `/7dtm day set <N>` | N = day number | Set current game day |
| `/7dtm bloodmoon start` | — | Force immediate blood moon |
| `/7dtm bloodmoon skip` | — | Skip next blood moon |
| `/7dtm heat set <0-100>` | Chunk heat override | Set heatmap value |
| `/7dtm spawner clear <radius>` | Blocks radius | Kill all zombies in area |
| `/7dtm level <player> <N>` | Player, level | Set player level |
| `/7dtm give <player> <item> [qty] [quality]` | Item registry name | Give item with quality |
| `/7dtm trader reset` | — | Force all trader restocks |
| `/7dtm poi regen <radius>` | Blocks | Regenerate POIs in radius |
| `/7dtm debug heatmap` | — | Toggle heatmap visualization |
| `/7dtm debug spawns` | — | Toggle spawn point visualization |
| `/7dtm config reload` | — | Hot-reload config files |
| `/7dtm weather radstorm` | — | Force radiation storm **(2.6 NEW)** |

### 15.5 Multiplayer Sync

- **Per-player heatmap contributions**: Each player adds to shared chunk heatmap; blood moon calculates per-player or worst-player (config).
- **Shared POI state**: Block damage, looted containers synced globally.
- **Party/Alliance system**: Share XP (15% to nearby party members), shared land claims.
- **PvP toggleable**: Config `pvp.enabled`, per-player `/pvp toggle`.
- **Loot sharing**: First-touch ownership on containers (30-sec lockout, config).

### 15.6 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| TPS (server) | ≥18 TPS with 64 zombies per player | Async AI ticking, LOD pathfinding |
| Client FPS | ≥60 FPS (mid-range GPU) | Chunk-based mob culling, LOD models |
| Zombie pathfinding | <2ms per zombie per tick | Cached paths, hierarchical A*, spatial hashing |
| Heatmap updates | <0.5ms per tick | Chunk-level data, lazy evaluation |
| World gen | <500ms per chunk | Threaded structure placement, cached templates |
| Network | <100 KB/s per player | Delta sync, batched updates, compressed packets |

**Optimization strategies:**
- Zombie AI: Only full pathfind every 60 ticks (3 sec). Between: follow cached path + local obstacle avoidance.
- LOD entities: Beyond 64 blocks, zombies render as billboarded sprites.
- Async world gen: Structure placement on worker threads, merged into main thread on completion.
- Spatial hash grid for collision/proximity queries (O(1) average per query).
- Chunk-based heatmap: Only recalculate on player action events, not per-tick.

### 15.7 Configuration File Structure

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| World gen performance | High — slow chunk gen kills playability | Async generation, LOD, template caching, limit city density |
| Zombie AI TPS cost | High — 64+ pathfinding zombies per player | Hierarchical A*, cached paths, tick budget per entity |
| Mixin compatibility | Medium — breaking changes across MC versions | Pin to 1.21.x LTS, abstract Mixin targets behind interface |
| Content volume | High — 500+ recipes, 300+ POIs, 100+ perks | Data-driven JSON, community data pack support, template tools |
| Vehicle physics | Medium — MC engine not designed for vehicles | Keep physics simple, raycast-based, no true rigid body |
| Multiplayer desync | Medium — custom systems need robust netcode | Delta sync protocol, authoritative server for all game state |
| **Charged/Infernal chain attacks (2.6)** | Medium — performance with many chain events | Cap chain targets to 3, throttle to 1 event/sec per zombie |

### 21.4 Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations

| Pitfall | Description | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Mixin conflicts** | Other mods (e.g., OptiFine, Sodium) may target same methods | Use `@Inject` over `@Overwrite` where possible; test with popular mod combos; provide compatibility notes |
| **Chunk gen performance** | City generation with 300 POIs per region may stall chunk loading | Template caching, async placement on worker threads, limit concurrent structure operations to 2 per tick |
| **Chain lightning cascade** | Multiple Charged zombies could stunlock players indefinitely | 1.5s stunlock immunity after being Electrocuted; max 1 chain event per zombie per second |
| **Infernal fire trail lag** | Many fire blocks from multiple Infernals could tank TPS | Fire trail blocks auto-expire in 5 sec; capped at 50 active fire trail blocks per chunk |
| **FoodData Mixin fragility** | `FoodData` internal changes across MC versions | Abstract behind an interface `ISevenDaysFoodData`; test against 1.21.0, 1.21.1, 1.21.4 |
| **Vehicle entity desync** | Custom physics don't use vanilla movement prediction | Send position+velocity packets at 10 Hz; client-side interpolation with server correction |
| **Data pack breaking changes** | Community datapacks could break balance or crash | Schema validation on load; warn-and-skip invalid entries; version field in JSON |
| **Memory from heatmap** | Storing heat per loaded chunk could use significant RAM | Only store non-zero heat chunks; evict decayed-to-zero entries from map |
| **Bear squeeze mode** | Dynamic hitbox changes could cause entity clipping | Only allow squeeze when path requires it; restore normal box on open space |
| **Smell system (3.0 teaser)** | Incomplete feature may confuse players | Default to `false` in config; clear docs that it's a preview hook |

---

> **End of Specification** — This document constitutes the complete, consolidated, production-ready reference for the "Brutal Zombie Horde Survival" total-conversion mod, inspired by 7 Days to Die and aligned to the style of 7 Days to Die Stable 1.0 + Experimental 2.6 (Feb 25, 2026). Includes comprehensive visual/animation polish specifications (§14.7) for sprint poses, environmental VFX, body language, and immersion effects. A solo NeoForge developer can begin implementation at Milestone #1 with zero additional research.
