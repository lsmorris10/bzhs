## Features

### Survival Stats & HUD
- Custom **Food**, **Water**, **Stamina**, and **Temperature** systems replacing vanilla hunger/regen
- Full HUD overlay with stat bars, day counter, temperature readout, debuff display, and XP bar
- 360° **compass strip** at top-center with cardinal/intercardinal markers and heat level indicator
- **Minimap** in top-right corner with terrain colors, player dot, and nearby player tracking
- Player base health set to **100 HP** (50 hearts) for balanced combat against custom zombies
- Vanilla hunger bar, health hearts, and passive regen disabled via Mixins

### Debuffs (12 Types)
- **Bleeding** — Zombie hits (30% chance), stacks up to 3x, damage scales with stacks
- **Infection Stage 1/2** — Zombie hits (10% chance), stamina penalty → lethal drain if untreated
- **Sprain** — Fall 4-7 blocks, -30% movement speed for 30 minutes
- **Fracture** — Fall 8+ blocks, -60% movement speed + sprint blocked for 60 minutes
- **Concussion** — Explosion within 3 blocks, nausea/screen wobble for 45 seconds
- **Electrocuted** — Charged zombie hit, 1.5 second movement freeze
- **Stunned** — Cop bile or Cop/Demolisher explosion, 2 second movement freeze
- **Burn, Dysentery, Hypothermia, Hyperthermia, Radiation** — Various environmental triggers
- All debuffs clear on death

### Zombie System (18 Variants + 3 Modifiers)
- **Humanoid (15)**: Walker, Crawler, Soldier, Frozen Lumberjack, Bloated Walker, Spider Zombie, Feral Wight, Screamer, Cop, Demolisher, Nurse, Mutated Chuck, Behemoth, Charged, Infernal
- **Animals (3)**: Zombie Dog, Zombie Bear, Vulture
- **Special Mechanics**: Explosions, acid spit projectiles, chain lightning, fire trails, wall climbing, healing aura, screamer spawning, flying dive attacks, ground pound AoE
- **Modifiers**: Radiated (HP regen), Charged (chain lightning), Infernal (fire trail + burn)
- **Dual Speed System**: Night speed bonus when dayTime is in the night range (13000–23000), plus a separate darkness speed bonus when both block light and sky light are ≤ 7. When both conditions apply, the higher bonus is used (not additive)
- Zombies do NOT burn in sunlight
- Name tags and HP bars only visible with line-of-sight (not through walls)

### Blood Moon / Horde Night
- Every 7th night triggers a blood moon with escalating zombie waves
- Full timeline: warning at Day 6 evening → red sky → siren → horde waves → dawn cleanup
- Wave composition scales with game day (5 difficulty tiers)
- Day-based thresholds gate advanced variants (feral, demolisher, charged, infernal)
- Sleep prevented during active blood moon
- Red sky/fog visual effects

### Heatmap Activity System
- Player actions generate "heat" in nearby chunks (block breaking, torch placement, sprinting, explosions)
- Heat threshold spawning:
  - 25+: Scout Walkers
  - 50+: Screamer zombie
  - 75+: Mini-horde (8-12 mixed zombies)
  - 100: Continuous wave mode until heat drops
- Heat decays over time, radiates to neighboring chunks
- Spawning paused during blood moon

### Loot & Crafting
- **17 Core Materials** + Dukes Casino Token currency
- **7 Workstations**: Campfire, Grill, Workbench, Forge, Cement Mixer, Chemistry Station, Advanced Workbench — all with functional GUIs and fuel-based processing
- **8 Loot Containers**: Trash Pile, Cardboard Box, Gun Safe, Munitions Box, Supply Crate, Kitchen Cabinet, Medicine Cabinet, Bookshelf — loot scales with player level
- **Quality Tiers**: T1 Poor (x0.7) through T6 Legendary (x1.5) with color codes and mod slot scaling
- **Loot Stage**: `floor((level x 0.5) + (days x 0.3) + biomeBonus + perkBonus)`
- **Scrapping**: Break down items into materials (full yield at workbench, 50% in inventory)

### XP, Leveling & Perks
- XP from zombie kills and block mining
- Level-up formula: `XP_to_next = floor(1000 x level ^ 1.05)`
- +1 perk point per level, +1 bonus attribute point every 10 levels
- **5 Attribute Trees**: Strength, Perception, Fortitude, Agility, Intellect
- **45 Perks** (8 per tree + 5 Tier-10 masteries)
- Active perk effects: damage reduction, mining speed, health regen, stamina efficiency, temperature resistance, death-save (Unkillable), stealth kills (Ghost), and more

### Extended Day Cycle
- Day/night cycle doubled via **slower-tick approach** (TIME_SCALE=2) — game time advances 1 tick every 2 server ticks
- `dayTime` stays on vanilla 24,000-tick scale, so sun/moon rendering, F3 day counter, and all vanilla time logic work natively
- One full day takes ~40 real minutes instead of vanilla's ~20 minutes
- All blood moon, zombie behavior, and temperature thresholds use the natural `dayTime` values
- **Affected by TIME_SCALE**: day/night progression, sun/moon position, sleep cycle — anything driven by `dayTime`
- **NOT affected by TIME_SCALE**: server tick rate, debuff timers, heatmap decay, redstone, mob AI ticks — these all run on server ticks at normal speed

## Documentation

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`docs/heatmap_guide.md`](docs/heatmap_guide.md) | Heatmap system mechanics with exact values |
| [`docs/debuffs_guide.md`](docs/debuffs_guide.md) | All 12 debuffs with triggers, effects, and durations |

## Building

Requires **Java 21**.

```bash
./gradlew build --no-daemon
```

Output JAR: `build/libs/BrutalZombieHordeSurvival-0.1.0-alpha.jar`

Copy the JAR into your Minecraft `mods/` folder (requires NeoForge 21.4.140 for Minecraft 1.21.4).
